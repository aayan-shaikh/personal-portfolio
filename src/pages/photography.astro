                As the founder of <strong>WebMinds</strong> and <strong
                    >Aayan Shaikh Photography</strong
                >, I've led a team of photographers, videographers, and editors
                on everything from in-flight helicopter shoots (yes, really) to
                club nights, interiors, and branding campaigns.
            </p>

            <p>
                My style is all about capturing the real moments‚Äîthe laughter,
                the chaos, the epic dance fails (don't worry, I'll crop out the
                embarrassing bits). Need a creative director who can also
                moonwalk? Let's talk.
