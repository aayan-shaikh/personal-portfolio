## Profile

Why pick just one passion when you can juggle four? I’m Aayan—a product executive by daylight, DJ by moonlight, photographer when the moment’s right, and a dancer whenever the music dares me. I thrive where creativity meets logic, mixing beats, pixels, and Python scripts with equal enthusiasm. If you need someone who can launch a product, spin a set, and debug your website—sometimes all before lunch—I’m your guy.
