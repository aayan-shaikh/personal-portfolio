**Home**

Hey there, I’m Aayan Shaikh—your friendly neighborhood DJ, photographer, dancer, and code wrangler. If you’re here, you probably love good music, good vibes, or you clicked the wrong link (in which case, stick around—you might just have a good time). Based in Pune, I split my time between spinning beats, snapping photos, busting moves, and debugging code. Life’s too short to pick just one passion, so I decided to juggle them all—sometimes literally. Dive in and see what happens when you mix disco lights, dance shoes, camera lenses, and Python scripts in one portfolio.

**DJ**

If you’ve ever wondered what happens when a dancer hijacks the DJ booth, wonder no more. As the resident DJ at Cobbler and Crew (India’s #2 bar—my mom’s still not impressed), I specialize in mixing **Kizomba, Bachata, Salsa, Retro, Disco, House, EDM, and Commercial**. My sets are a blend of old-school grooves and modern bangers, designed to keep your feet moving and your Fitbit confused.

I’ve had the pleasure of opening for artists like Karan Kanchan, The Yellow Diary, and SuReal, and playing at venues all over Pune. My secret sauce? A dancer’s ear for rhythm, a crate of vinyl classics, and a refusal to play “Despacito” more than twice a night. After my set, you’ll usually find me at the bar, pretending to understand wine lists and chatting with anyone who’ll listen.

**Photography**

When I’m not behind the decks, I’m usually behind a lens—because why settle for one kind of flash? As the founder of WebMinds and Aayan Shaikh Photography, I’ve led a team of photographers, videographers, and editors on everything from in-flight helicopter shoots (yes, really) to club nights, interiors, and branding campaigns. If it stands still long enough, I’ll probably photograph it.

My style is all about capturing the real moments—the laughter, the chaos, the epic dance fails (don’t worry, I’ll crop out the embarrassing bits). Need a creative director who can also moonwalk? Let’s talk.

**Dancer**

Dancing isn’t just my side quest—it’s my secret weapon. Trained in **Bachata, Kizomba, Jive, Cha Cha, and Rumba**, I’ve learned that the only thing more satisfying than nailing a triple spin is DJing for people who can actually keep up. I even snagged 3rd place at the Dubai Bachata Amateur Jack and Jill competition—proof that sometimes, my feet know what they’re doing.

I’m always up for a workshop, a social, or a spontaneous dance-off (bonus points if you bring snacks). Whether I’m on stage or on the floor, I’m here for the music, the movement, and the occasional dramatic dip.

**Programmer**

By day (and sometimes by night, if the caffeine holds out), I’m a product executive and programmer. I’ve worked with brands like boAt Lifestyle, leading research for flagship audio products, wrangling Python scripts, and turning market research into actual, usable products. My skills include:
- Python scripting (for when you need your life automated)
- Website design and SEO (so your mom can finally find your portfolio)
- Data analysis (because someone has to make sense of all those Spotify stats)
- Content optimization and digital marketing

I’ve published research on blockchain and CBDC in India, and I’m always up for a tech challenge—unless it involves fixing printers. That’s where I draw the line.

*If you made it this far, congrats! You’ve officially unlocked the “Aayan Multiverse.” Let’s create something epic—just don’t ask me to pick a favorite between music, dance, photos, or code. That’s like asking a DJ to play just one genre.*
